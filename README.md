<b>Simple Linear Regression in Machine Learning<br></b>

Simple Linear Regression is a type of Regression algorithms that models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. The relationship shown by a Simple Linear Regression model is linear or a sloped straight line, hence it is called Simple Linear Regression.<br>

<b>Simple Linear regression algorithm has mainly two objectives:</b><br>
Model the relationship between the two variables. Such as the relationship between Income and expenditure, experience and Salary, etc.<br>
Forecasting new observations. Such as Weather forecasting according to temperature, Revenue of a company according to the investments in a year, etc.<br>
